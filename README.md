# Credit-Scores
This is my quick take on the xente challenge from Zindi
This challenge is an invitational challenge designed in association with Standard Bank, specifically for the Standard Bank Tech Impact Challenge (SBTIC) Finals. Welcome to the SBTIC participants!

If you are at the SBTIC Finals taking place from 30 August to 3 September 2019 in Johannesburg, South Africa, you may enter this challenge by giving your email address to the Zindi representative.

After the SBTIC, this competition will be re-opened as a Points Challenge to allow others in the Zindi community to learn and test their skills.

According to the Uganda FinScope 2018 survey findings, 46% (8.5 million) adults borrowed money during the 12-month period prior to the survey, with the majority borrowing to cover regular living expenses (such as education) during low-income periods. Further, the largest source of borrowing is from informal lenders i.e. savings groups, burial societies, community-based money lenders etc.


Xente is a Ugandan e-commerce startup that makes it easy for consumers to make payments, get loans, and shop using simply a mobile phone. Using the Xente app you can access personal loans of from UGX 500 – UGX 3,000,000.* The funds can be deposited into your Xente wallet, and then transferred into your Xente Visa card, mobile money wallet, or bank account. You can make transactions using the app using your mobile money or bank card.Alternatively, you can use the funds to buy any product or service in the Xente app. Xente also has a “Buy Now & Pay Later” option, for products such as airtime and data, bill payments, utilities, movies, and bus tickets.**


The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to default on their loans, based on their loan repayment behaviour and ecommerce transaction activity.

The resulting models and solutions will help Xente refine their credit decision processes, and enable them to more adequately assess the creditworthiness of new and existing clients. For Xente, this may result in improved profitability and financial sustainability; while for Xente’s cliente, increased creditworthiness would enhance their access to credit and contribute to an improved livelihood.

This challenge is hosted by Xente, in association with Standard Bank
